- ~~No Stack Handling~~

### Registers

| Name | Size in Bits | Purpose                                  | Reset Contents   |
| ---- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| A    | 4            | Accumulator and General Purpose Register | `0000`           |
| B    | 4            | Auxilary and General Purpose Register    | `0000`           |
| PC   | 12           | Program Counter                          | `0000 0000 0000` |
| SP   | 12           | Stack Pointer                            | `1111 1111 1111` |

~~All Registers except B have a buffer version, for instances where PC is being modified while also being used, i.e. LDD PC,0x005 needs PC to load the data from memory, but is also overwriting PC~~

### Flags

| Name | Purpose                                 | Reset Contents |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Z    | Zero Flag (based on A Register)         | `0`            |
| C    | Carry Flag (based on last Calculation)  | `0`            |
| B    | Borrow Flag (based on last Calculation) | `0`            |
| P    | Even Parity Flag (based on A Register)  | `0`            |

### How to read Core Memory
1. Send pulse to X-Y Lines
2. Sense Pulse/Lack of Pulse
3. Schmitt-Trigger the Pulse for better loading
4. Store in D-Flip-Flop
5. Read Result
