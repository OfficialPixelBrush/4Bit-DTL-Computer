### Registers

| Name | Size in Bits | Purpose                                  | Reset Contents   |
| ---- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| A    | 4            | Accumulator and General Purpose Register | `0000`           |
| B    | 4            | Auxilary and General Purpose Register    | `0000`           |
| PC   | 12           | Program Counter                          | `0000 0000 0000` |
| SP   | 12           | Stack Pointer                            | `1111 1111 1111` |

All Registers except B have a buffer version, for instances where PC is being modified while also being used, i.e. LDD PC,0x005 needs PC to load the data from memory, but is also overwriting PC

### Flags

| Name | Purpose                                 | Reset Contents |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Z    | Zero Flag (based on A Register)         | `0`            |
| B    | Borrow Flag (based on last Calculation) | `0`            |
| C    | Carry Flag (based on last Calculation)  | `0`            |
| P    | Even Parity Flag (based on A Register)  | `0`            |

## Instruction Cycle
Using NAND Instruction as an Example

### Register Contents

| Reg          | Content |
| ------------ | ------- |
| A Register   | 0101    |
| B Register   | 1111    |
| Instruction  | xxxx    |
| CycleCounter | xxxx    | 

### Memory Map

| 0x000 - 0x3FF | 0x400 - 0x7FF | 0x800 - 0xBFF | 0xC00 - 0xFFF |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Core Memory   |               |               |               |

**0x000-0x3FF**

| 0x000 - 0x0FF | 0x100 - 0x3FF |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|               |               |

### How to read Core Memory
1. Send pulse to X-Y Lines
2. Sense Pulse/Lack of Pulse
3. Schmitt-Trigger the Pulse for better loading
4. Store in D-Flip-Flop
5. Read Result
